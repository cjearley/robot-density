# robot-density
A comparison of one predicted robot density versus the actual robot densities of some countries

Code for [a blog post] (https://craigearley.com/2017/04/25/robot-forecasting-circa-1978/ "Robot forecasting, circa 1978").

Relevant excerpt to explain:

>The story draws its inevitably ominous conclusion:
> >By 2000, scientists predict, there will be one robot for every 500 blue-collar workers, and robots will be smarter than humans and able to reproduce themselves for their own ends. And then, it is possible, but not likely, that the human dream of owning the perfect slave will turn into a nightmare, as the robots turn their attention to their human masters.
>For what it's worth, here are the 2015 robot density figures for a few advanced countries and for the world (figures from the International Federation of Robotics, [highlighted by] (https://www.roboticsbusinessreview.com/manufacturing/new-robot-density-must-track-global-robotics-growth/) Robotics Business Review). Note that this chart shows robot density for all workers, not just blue-collar workers, so the apples-to-apples ratio should be even more dramatic given the smaller denominator.
